# Templates directory

Place your reference icons/images here for visual checks.

Recommended files:

- open.png: An icon or unique UI element that is visible when the application is open.
- corner-top-left.png: A stable UI anchor near the top-left of the app when maximized.
- corner-top-right.png: A stable UI anchor near the top-right of the app when maximized.
- corner-bottom-left.png: A stable UI anchor near the bottom-left of the app when maximized.
- corner-bottom-right.png: A stable UI anchor near the bottom-right of the app when maximized.

Notes:

- Capture the templates at the same display scale (DPI) as runtime.
- Prefer small, high-contrast, and unique regions (20â€“80 px on a side is often enough).
- PNG with no compression artifacts is preferred.
