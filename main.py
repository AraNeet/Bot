Automation Bot - Main Entry Point

This is the primary entry point for the Automation Bot system, which provides
automated application task management.

On startup, the system performs the following steps:
!. Load Config, Check if program is running
2. Open application if not running it open the application
3. Maximize application window if the is not maximized it tries 3 times
4. Then it checks if the application is open and maximized using corner templates
After successful startup, the system is ready. And proceeds to instruction parsing.
1. Load instruction file
2. Parse objectives and check if supported
3. Then email the unsupported objectives if any
4. Pass supported objectives to workflow module (not implemented yet).

Next Steps (TODO):
- Add a Instruction executer module for task execution.
