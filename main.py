Automation Bot - Main Entry Point

This is the primary entry point for the Automation Bot system, which provides
automated application task management.

On startup, the system performs the following steps:
!. Load Config, Check if program is running
2. Open application if not running it open the application
3. Maximize application window if the is not maximized it tries 3 times
4. Then it checks if the application is open and maximized using corner templates

Next Steps (TODO):
- Add Parser mode for instruction analysis.
- Add a Instruction executer module for task execution.

    Main execution function for the Application Manager Bot system.
    
    This function coordinates the entire system lifecycle:
    1. System initialization (configuration and validation)
    2. Standard mode execution (application startup sequence)
    3. Result reporting and system exit
    
    Standard Mode: Basic application startup sequence
